For example, it is useful in the following situations:
* In user support operations for web services, block modification requests (POST, PATCH, PUT, DELETE) to the target web site to prevent inadvertent modification of user data.
* In web development, block specific requests and make them fail to check the system behavior.
* When using a pay-as-you-go network, suppress communication charges by blocking request for image and media resources.

Features:
* Rule definition with flexibility
  * Rules can be defined to block or allow (exceptions to block) network requests based on domain, URL, request method, and resource type
* Safe as only minimal permissions are required
  * Unlike many other network blocking extensions, this extension does not require permissions to read and change all your data on all websites or to read your browsing history
* Work results can be checked
  * Users can view a list of rules that blocked or allowed requests within a specific tab

The conditions for blocking or allowing, definable as rules, are as follows:
* Request Domains
* Initiator Domains
* Request Methods
* URL Filter
* Resource Types
