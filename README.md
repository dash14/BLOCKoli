# BLOCKoli

BLOCKoli (pronounced /bl…ë'k…ôli/, like the "R" in broccoli with an "L") is
a Chrome extension that allows you to block or allow web network requests with
easy configuration.

For example, it is useful in the following situations:
* In user support operations for web services, block modification requests (POST, PATCH, PUT, DELETE) to the target web site to prevent inadvertent modification of user data.
* In web development, block specific requests and make them fail to check the system behavior.
* When using a pay-as-you-go network, suppress communication charges by blocking request for image and media resources.

The following features are available:
* Define the conditions for blocking or allowing (exceptions to blocking) network requests that occur on the browser as rules
* Enable or disable entire rules
* Display a list of blocked or passed rules in a browser tab

The conditions for blocking or allowing, definable as rules, are as follows:
* Request Domains
* Initiator Domains
* Request Methods
* URL Filter
* Resource Types
